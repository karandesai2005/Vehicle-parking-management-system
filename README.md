# Vehicle Parking Management System 🚗🏍️🚚

This is a **C++ project** that simulates a vehicle parking management system using **object-oriented programming (OOP)** principles, specifically hierarchical inheritance. It handles the parking and unparking of different types of vehicles, such as cars, trucks, and motorcycles, in a parking lot with a fixed capacity.


## Features ✨
- Support for three vehicle types: **Car**, **Truck**, and **Motorcycle**.
- Efficient **parking** and **unparking** management.
- A parking lot with a fixed number of slots (`MaxSlots = 20`).
- Dynamic management of available parking slots with user-friendly feedback.
- Demonstrates OOP concepts like **inheritance**, **encapsulation**, and **polymorphism**.

## How It Works 🛠️
The system uses a **ParkingLot** class to manage an array of parking slots, each of which can store a pointer to a **Vehicle** object. The **Vehicle** class is a base class with common vehicle attributes such as `vehicleID` and `vehicleType`. The derived classes (**Car**, **Truck**, **Motorcycle**) inherit from the **Vehicle** class and represent specific vehicle types.

Each vehicle can be:
- **Parked**: If there is space available, the vehicle will be assigned a slot and its details will be displayed.
- **Unparked**: When a vehicle leaves, its slot is freed, and the system prints a message indicating the vehicle has been unparked.

The system checks for slot availability and handles cases where the parking lot is full.

## OOP Concepts 🚀
This project showcases several important **object-oriented programming** principles:
- **Hierarchical Inheritance**: The `Vehicle` class serves as the base class, and the `Car`, `Truck`, and `Motorcycle` classes inherit from it.
- **Encapsulation**: The parking management functions (`park`, `unpark`) are encapsulated within the `ParkingLot` class, ensuring that the functionality is modular.
- **Polymorphism**: The project leverages the flexibility of pointers to manage objects of different derived classes (Car, Truck, Motorcycle) through the base class (`Vehicle`).

## Installation 💻

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/VehicleParkingManagementSystem.git
   cd VehicleParkingManagementSystem
   ```

2. **Compile the Project**
   You can use any C++ compiler to run this project. For instance, using `g++`:
   ```bash
   g++ main.cpp -o parking_system
   ```

3. **Run the Executable**
   ```bash
   ./parking_system
   ```

## Usage 📋
Once the program is running, it will automatically simulate parking and unparking for different vehicles:
- The system first parks and unparks a **Car**.
- Then, it parks and unparks a **Truck**.
- Finally, it parks and unparks a **Motorcycle**.

The program will display messages indicating the vehicle type and ID, along with its parking and unparking status.
